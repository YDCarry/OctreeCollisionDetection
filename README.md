# OctreeCollisionDetection

This is a simple implementation of Collision Detection algorithm using Octree.

We have a box with the upper and lower walls shown; the rest of the walls are invisible. Every time you press the space bar, it will randomly add 20 balls to the box. They fall with gravity and bounce off of each other and the walls.

Just as this picture showsï¼š
